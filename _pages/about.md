I am currently a autonomous driving researcher at Nissan Motor Corporation, I apply my expertise in computer science and machine learning to develop innovative solutions for motion and behavior prediction systems. With a Ph.D. from the University of Colorado Denver and a Master's degree from Chonnam National University, I have a strong foundation in programming, Python, and machine learning.

In my previous roles, I have contributed to the development of an augmented behavior model for agent trajectory prediction as a research intern at Honda Research Institute USA, Inc., and published six peer-reviewed articles on understanding and predicting human motion, intention, and behaviors for robot's vision and autonomous driving as a research assistant at the University of Colorado Denver. I am passionate about advancing the field of artificial intelligence and its applications in robotics and autonomous systems.
